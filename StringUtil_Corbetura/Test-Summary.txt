Only 85% statement coverage can be attained wince we can not instantiate the StringUtil class because
pluralize is a static method as well as due to the fact that non of the statements in the main method
will ever be executed by the unit tests.

Added the following tests to StrintUtilTest.java to attain a 71% branch coverage:

      {"equipment", "equipment"},
      {"children", "child"},
      {"bays", "bay"},
      {"abbies", "abby"},
      {null, null}

However due to the fact the line 41 in StringUtil.java should be changed from:

  (c2 != 'a' || c2 != 'e' || c2 == 'i' || c2 == 'o' || c2 == 'u'))

to the following:

  (c2 != 'a' && c2 != 'e' && c2 == 'i' && c2 == 'o' && c2 == 'u'))

and that the main method can't be ever executed by the unit tests no greater branch coverage can be
attained without fixing the code.
